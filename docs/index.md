Image Percent Diff
==================

Calculates the percent area that two images differ. There's currently a single function, `img_percent_diff`, that calculates this percent area. You just provide it with the path to two files:

```python
from img_percent_diff import img_percent_diff
img_percent_diff('/path/to/image1.png', '/path/to/image2.png')
```
